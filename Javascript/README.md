# VaangoUI
An attempt to create an user interface for Vaango in Typescript/ES6
using the 15 year old Java/Swing UintahUI as a template.

To build the VaangoUI.js file with Webpack, use

npm run build

Then open the index.html file in a browser.  At present we don't need to
start a HTTP server for the project.
